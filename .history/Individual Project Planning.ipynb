    "There are a few issues with this dataset. Firstly within the experience variable, we do not know how each of the categories are measured. What makes a player a pro compared to a veteran, regular, or amateur? How were the players put into these categories? Does it have to do with their age or maybe by how many hours they have played? Another issue is in the number of hours played for the players. Are these hours referring to the players total played hours in their whole life, per day, or is it an average over a specific amount of time? Understanding the experience and hours played variables in a more in depth fashion would help us use this data when answering a question and formulating predictions.\n",
